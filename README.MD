# Gemma Model with Hugging Face Transformers in TensorFlow



This project showcases the implementation and utilization of the Gemma Model, a 2 billion parameter base model, using the Hugging Face Transformers library within TensorFlow. Designed to demonstrate the power and flexibility of transformer models for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, this repository offers a comprehensive guide to using pre-trained models, custom model training, and inference with state-of-the-art architectures.

## Features

- **Pre-trained Model Usage:** Learn how to leverage pre-trained models from Hugging Face for a variety of NLP tasks.
- **Transformer Architectures:** Detailed exploration of architectures like BERT, GPT, RoBERTa, and more.
- **Tokenization and Data Preparation:** Guide on preparing your text data for model training and inference.
- **Custom Model Training:** Instructions on how to fine-tune and train transformer models on your dataset.
- **Inference and Deployment:** Techniques for deploying your trained model for making predictions on new data.
- **GPU Utilization:** Insights on using GPU resources (specifically, a P100) for efficient model training.
